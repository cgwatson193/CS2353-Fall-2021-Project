# CS2353-FALL-2021-PROJECT
PURPOSE:
Shows the use case of boolean logic in a real-world scenario 

WHAT:
This program utilizes a basic integrity check function, which is a simple type of checksum.

COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS (C++ Code):
To compile: g++ main.cpp
To run: ./{name of executable}

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The program will prompt you to type in a string.
After entering the string, you will see the result of T or F based on a basic integrity check function.

ABOUT:
This integrity check function checks the underlying string and outputs if
the string has an odd number of 1 bits (True) or even number of 1 bits (False).

A verification check is included to check that the algorithm worked correctly.
"CHECK PASSED" indicates that the function outputted the correct value and vice versa.
